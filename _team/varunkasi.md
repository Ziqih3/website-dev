Varun is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute. Prior to this, he worked as an adjunct teaching professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where he taught courses in structural engineering, laser scanning, and digital twins for civil infrastructure. Varun obtained his Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from CMU in 2021, and his thesis focused on using point cloud data to automatically detect and measure spall defects in concrete bridges.

Varun's recent work involves the use of stereo and LiDAR-enhanced SfM to improve the detection and quantification of spall defects. This research is relevant to the inspection of built infrastructure assets.
